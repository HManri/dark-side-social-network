# Dark Side Social Network

## ðŸ§­ Description

The Social Network from the Dark Side. Come with use, we have cookies!

This is an exercise to use the most common things used in React in a same project.
You can access to https://hectormanrique.com/dark-side-social-network/ and see the result!

## ðŸ’¡ To take in consideration

-   There is no API here.
-   The app have some initial data stored on files (users and messages).
-   The service layer which connect to the backend/API/DB isn't optimized - we don't have any API to store and get data
-   The app is storing data of user interactions using localStorage Web API
    -   So don't use any browser with this API blocked, like Safari in private browsing.
-   There is a fake Login page. There isn't password validation (there isn't password on user's data), but it can be used to switch between the different users.

## ðŸ”Œ How to use it

-   You can run the project in your local machine, or compile it before and use a "production mode" version. See "**Useful scripts**" section on this document.
-   The login page have a user filled by default (_dvader_), but you can use any other user present in user's file (**src/app/mocks/users.js**).

## ðŸ“œ Required software

-   node v14.15.4
-   npm v6.14.10 (in case you use npm) [not recommended]
-   yarn v1.22.10 (in case you use yarn) [recommended]
